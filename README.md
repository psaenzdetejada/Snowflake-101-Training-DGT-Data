## Use Case
Dear Snowflake User,
We are seeking a skilled data engineering team to build a robust and scalable data workload on our Snowflake platform, leveraging data from the Spanish Dirección General de Tráfico (DGT) regarding vehicle registrations. This project requires a comprehensive approach, starting with the initial setup of our Snowflake environment. We need assistance in defining and implementing appropriate roles, virtual warehouses, and resource monitors to ensure optimal performance and cost management. The core of the workload will involve ingesting large volumes of JSON data files from the DGT, requiring expertise in Snowflake's COPY INTO command and data staging.

Furthermore, we need to create and populate dimension tables to enrich the raw registration data, facilitating detailed analysis. The team will be responsible for designing and implementing a data pipeline to transform the raw JSON into well-structured silver and gold layers. Finally, we want to harness the power of Snowflake's advanced capabilities, including basic analysis using Notebooks and enabling natural language querying with Snowflake Cortex to democratize data access and generate actionable insights. We are looking for a consultancy firm that can deliver a complete, end-to-end Snowflake solution that aligns with our business goals.

## Original data
The original data used to build this training is available at: https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/matraba-listados/matriculaciones-automoviles-diario.html

## Previous transformation
For a more meaningful learning experience, the data has been reshaped for this training session from a plain-text format to a json format, in order to learn how we can work with semi-structured data in Snowflake.
